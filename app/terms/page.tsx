      <p>
        PIN is a blockchain-based experiment featuring daily auctions, link
        redirections, and reward claims. Participation is fully onchain,
        voluntary, and experimental. By interacting with the $PIN web interface,
        smart contracts, or related tools (the “Platform”), including connecting
        your wallet or submitting a bid, you agree to these Terms and our
        Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, do not use the Platform.

        <li>
          <strong>Acceptance & Eligibility</strong>
          <br />
          You represent that you are (a) at least 18 years old, (b) legally
          capable of entering contracts in your jurisdiction, and (c) not
          subject to sanctions or restrictions prohibiting use of Ethereum-based
          services. The Platform is for entertainment, experimentation, and
          creative expression. It is not a lottery, sweepstakes, or investment
          product.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Non-Custodial Wallet Use</strong>
          <br />
          The Platform does not custody assets or manage user wallets. You
          interact directly with Ethereum wallets and smart contracts. You are
          solely responsible for securing your private keys and wallet
          credentials.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>How $PIN works</strong>
          <br />
          The highest bidder in the daily $PIN auction gains control of the link
          on pinmytweet.xyz for a 24-hour period, starting immediately after the
          auction ends. The winning user may specify a valid external URL (e.g.,
          a tweet, project site, or meme link). Winners must provide a valid
          URL; we reserve the right to review and reject for any reason,
          including safety, without refund.. We do not endorse, verify, or
          control redirect destinations. Users access external content at their
          own risk. Bids are non-refundable; auction outcomes are final and
          on-chain.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No Securities or Investment Advice</strong>
          <br />
          $PIN is a memecoin. It is not a security, share, investment contract,
          or financial product. No part of the Platform provides investment
          advice. You do not earn profits, dividends, or ownership rights from
          $PIN. Participation is for entertainment purposes only.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Risks</strong>
          <br />
          You acknowledge and accept risks including (but not limited to): Price
          volatility and token illiquidity Smart contract bugs or exploits
          Irreversible transactions Sybil resistance errors Regulatory changes
          or enforcement Ineligibility for token rewards due to abuse prevention
          You are solely responsible for any tax liabilities or legal compliance
          arising from your activity Network congestion delaying auctions
          Technical failures, including site downtime or redirect errors
          Malicious or deceptive external content Traffic hijacking or abuse
          through malicious redirect destinations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>User Conduct</strong>
          <br />
          You must use the Platform lawfully and avoid submitting or linking to
          harmful, illegal, or abusive content. Prohibited content includes but
          is not limited to: malware, phishing, hate speech, scams,
          impersonation, financial fraud, or sexually explicit material. No
          deceptive redirects that hide the final destination. We reserve the
          right to reject the winning link without reimbursement. You may not
          attempt to exploit, bypass, or interfere with core mechanics. Abuse of
          reward systems may result in restriction or nullification of claims.
          Violations may result in permanent wallet bans from future auctions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No Representations or Warranties</strong>
          <br />
          We make no representations, warranties, or commitments regarding
          $PIN’s current or future value, functionality, adoption, or ongoing
          development.

        <li>
          <strong>Intellectual Property</strong>
          <br />
          $PIN and its associated branding, code, and interfaces are owned by
          the project creators. You retain rights to any original content you
          link to via redirect, but grant $PIN a royalty-free license to
          publicly display associated metadata such as link previews, titles,
          and thumbnails during the redirect period.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Third-Party Services</strong>
          <br />
          Wallets, explorers, blockchains, analytics tools, and redirect
          destinations are third-party services. $PIN coin has no control over
          these and disclaims responsibility for their performance or content.
          Redirect destinations are controlled entirely by auction winners. We
          disclaim all responsibility for external content, including illegal,
          harmful, or fraudulent material.
        </li>

          We may modify or disable off-chain features (such as redirect UI) at
          any time for legal, technical, or strategic reasons. The core smart
          contracts onchain are permissionless.

          purpose, non-infringement, and availability.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Limitation of Liability</strong>

        <li>
          <strong>Changes to Terms</strong>

          are posted. Continued use constitutes acceptance.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Severability</strong>
          <br />
          If any clause is unenforceable, the remainder of the Terms remains in
          effect, with minimal adjustment to preserve intent.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Content Moderation</strong>
          <br />
          While we reserve the right to reject winning links, we are under no
          obligation to monitor or moderate redirect destinations. Users are
          solely responsible for compliance with applicable laws.
